# Group Theory in Physics: An Introduction with Mathematica
### Balasubramanian Ananthanarayan, Souradeep Das, Amitabha Lahiri, Suhas Sheikh, Sarthak Talukdar



  Group Theory has become an invaluable tool in the physics community. Despite numerous introductory books, the subject remains challenging for beginners. Mathematica has emerged as a popular tool for research and education, offering various packages and built-in tools for Group Theory. However, these resources are often too scattered for effective educational use. This work aims to provide a comprehensive source to help beginning students grasp Group Theory concepts and their applications from a physicist's perspective, while also building familiarity with symbolic language. We present several example notebooks that succinctly cover well-known theories and demonstrate specific concepts, which can be easily adapted for educational purposes. We provide basic examples on finite, compact and non-compact groups, and motivate the use of these concepts in solving physics problems such as addition of angular momenta, modelling a system of qubits and the description of spacetime transformations.

## About this Repository:

* This repository contains the Mathematica notebooks listed in the book in the chapter "List of Notebooks".
* These contain the codes for generating the results in different parts of the book, whose snippets have been used in the text.
* Besides, the repository also contains some working examples in various topics such as root diagrams and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
* One needs to use specific Mathematica packages in order to run some of the notebooks, for example:
   * To run the file ```SU4_Baryons.nb``` one would need to install the package **SimpleGroups.m**, which is available at https://avladimirov.net/images/ExtraMaterials/SimpleGroups/SimpleGroupsver098b.m
* The readers are advised to solve the exercises given in the text using (modified versions of) these notebooks.
